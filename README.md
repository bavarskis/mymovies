# My Movies

**My Movies** is a movie browsing app which allows you to mark movies as `favorites`. Yay.
It is a demo app built with `SwiftUI` :fireworks: 


## Setting up

The app consumes [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) API token, which can be generated by creating an account with them. It is a static token stored in a text file. The text file is ignored by `Git`, so it can not be found in this project. Place the token text in a file named `moviedbtoken.txt` and add it to the app bundle. If there are no typos the app should be able to access the movie data base. **Note**: The app uses `version 3` API, make sure you use the `api_key` and not the `Bearer` token.

## Strucure and architecture

The project is split into `Core` and `Modules` groups. `Core` contains the code which is shared across the codebase such as networking objects, error, configuration, etc., while `Modules` contain feature specific code. 

The leading design pattern of the project is `MVVM` combined with `Dependency Injection`. `View Models` are unit tested, but higher testing coverage is needed. 

## Remaining work

The app still needs more styling and UI improvements such as empty states, placeholders, etc. Error handling also needs some more work. Collection views are not paginated.
